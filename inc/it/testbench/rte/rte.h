/*!
 * RuntimeEngine class aims at defining the APIs to provide access to the core engine capabilities.
 *
 * It acts as a fa√ßade wrapping in simple but effective APIs the asynchronous
 * processing capabilities offered by the core engine behind it.
 *
 * It implements the half sync-async pattern to provide synchronous APIs to the clients,
 * and hiding the asynchronous processing logic offered by the engine.
 *
 * It acts as Subject for entities interested in notifications meanwhile a test plan is
 * under execution. Moreover, itself acts as Observer of report consumer thread to collect
 * the notifications of the running test plan.
 *
 * It implements the Thread Pool pattern, detaching and managing a pool of worker threads.
